# chip8emu
CHIP8 emulator written in C++23

# TODO
- SDL3 (separated from the chip8 class: use a getter for the screen to get and render it from outside of the class. Also, extract the main loop from the run() method)
- command line arguments for emulator config (or GUI before running the emulator)
- github actions
